These past couple weeks have been a little crazy to say the least. Obviously the big topic on everyone's mind is     COVID-19 and it's not any different for me and my family. Life still goes on though, I still have to go to work and I still have to make time to code but it has definitely been harder lately. It really just leads me to better appreciate the opportunity that flatiron gives me and albeit a little late, I finally got to finish this sinatra project.

So this is my second portfolio project and honestly the checklist for this one was a lot easier. Maybe it's because I had so much time to think about it but I feel like having more creative freedom in choosing the design of the whole project as opposed to creating a CLI for an already made website just made it easier. Also the way the learn.co labs were set up definitely helped me visualize what my code was gonna look like. 

1. Come up with an idea for this project
     - The project outline had asked for a database or collection of things that could be personal to me. It wasn't too hard to         meet this criteria given that whatever I chose had
        a. This collection could have many different objects
				b. These objects have at least a couple attributes that could be used to differentiate them
				c. These objects either had or belonged to something else
		- So I came up with doing cars and went one more step ahead and decided that the cars could belong to different                    garages. A little simple but it's something that I thought would be a nice addition to users just having cars
2. Set up the initial code
    - Most of this step was made easy thanks to the corneal gem but because of the labs I had done previously, I knew that        the foundation I needed to start with was mapping out the tables of the database, visualizing the end product, then              creating the files that I knew I would need for the project
3. The bulk of the code
     - Since I knew what my code was going to look like and how it was gonna function, It wasn't hard to get into a rhythm of         going by CRUD, creating the initial 'get' path, the erb file for each path in view, and then any 'post/patch/delete'                       methods that came after
4. Debugging
     - Almost definitely the hardest part of the project. I think where this got hard was not only identifying what exactly went         wrong but
        a. Finding the exact lines of code that were producing the problem
				b. Finding an elegant solution for the problem
				c. Keeping the fixed code relevant and readable within the context of the program as a whole
				
It's been a busy hectic time but I definitely could have done better to make time to get this project done faster. Moving forwards I think the big thing that I should focus on improving is being able to read and debug code. Having had to debug my own code, even if it's on a smaller scale compared to what a professional would have to do, I understand better that being able to read and fix code is a skill in itself. Knowing that, it's definitely something I aim to improve on in the future; the ability to create code thats easy to read and understand and to be able to stay consistent with that when debugging that code.
